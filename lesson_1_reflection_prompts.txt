How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I know the text wich was been changed, it was then easy to find it in a file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can always go back to previous version if I mess up too much in the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I decide in wich point I want save changes, but I might forget to doi it and then...

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    When there is relation with the changes in files it's better to have it as one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log - shows all commits, while git diff shows differents between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always back to previous "good" veriosn of files 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Don't know yet.
